# Netflix-Clone
Html Css project
Creating a Netflix clone using HTML and CSS involves replicating the visual design and layout of the Netflix website. This includes structuring the page with HTML and styling it with CSS to achieve a similar look and feel. While this clone will be static and won't have the actual functionality of Netflix, it provides a great opportunity to practice front-end web development skills, including layout design, responsive design, and styling.
